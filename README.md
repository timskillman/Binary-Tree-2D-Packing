# Binary-Tree-2D-Packing
Xamarin version of Binary Tree Algorithm for 2D Bin Packing based on Jakes Gordon's code (with Growing Packer)

Jakes Gordon's original code can be found at https://github.com/jakesgordon/bin-packing/

Demo renders 150 random rectangles that are sorted from large to small areas and then packed using the algorithm.

Rectangles are rendered using SkiaSharp.

Tested on Android although it should also work iOS.
